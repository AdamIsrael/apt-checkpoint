Description: Create, compare, and rollback point-in-time snapshots of a Debian system
 This command line utility allows you to create, compare, and rollback
 snapshots of a Debian system.  These checkpoints record the installation
 state of installed packages and offers a way to restore a Debian system
 to its previously working state in the case of broken packages 
 or failed upgrades.
