The idea behind apt-checkpoint/apt-rollback is to create a point-in-time snapshot of all installed packages, including a hard link to the original archive, if available.  In the case of a system failure, an apt-checkpoint rollback or apt-rollback could then be run, to restore the system to a known working order.

See snapshot.debian.net as a potential way of grabbing packages to be rolled back. (thanks harshy)

apt-checkpoint
apt-diff
apt-rollback
apt-clone?

Store checkpoint files in:
 /var/cache/apt/checkpoint/

Filename:
  Unix timestamp of when the checkpoint was created
? gzip the checkpoint to save space?
Checkpoint:
  All package states (installed, uninstalled, etc)
  Timestamp (YYYY/MM/DD)
  
  Package Name
  Package Version
  Timestamp
  
Flow:
	Get list of currently installed packages
	Save current date
